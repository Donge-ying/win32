# 📚 win32.pub Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io), a modern
static website generator.

## ⚙️ Installation

```sh
npm install
```

## 🧑‍💻 Local Development

```sh
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## 📦 Build

```sh
npm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be
served using any static contents hosting service.

## 🚀 Deployment

The documentation is automatically updated on every successful commit to the
`main` branch with a GitHub Action, which compiles and deploys new content to
the website at [win32.pub](https://win32.pub).
